# Define custom business role mappings, or remove mappings that come with 
# the default SOC deployment.

# IMPORTANT: This file should be copied from the salt/default tree into
#            the salt/local tree (preserving the same directory structure).
#            Failure to do this will result in the customizations being
#            overwritten on future upgrades.
#
# Syntax      => prebuiltRoleX: customRoleY: op
# Explanation => roleY and roleZ are adjusted permissions of roleX, op is:
#                + add the new permissions/role mappings (default)
#                - remove existing prebuilt permissions
#
# In the example below, we will define a new role for junior analysts,
# that is nearly identical to the analyst role that comes with SOC, with the
# exception that it removes their ability to obtain details about other 
# analysts in the system.
#
# analyst:        jr_analyst
# user-monitor:   jr_analyst:-
