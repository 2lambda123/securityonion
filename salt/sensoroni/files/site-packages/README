Once the sensoroni container starts, the target directory at /opt/so/conf/sensoroni/site-packages will be populated with all installed package dependencies, as specified by each analyzer's own requirements.txt.

While normally this source directory should be left empty, it can be pre-populated if an analyzer's dependencies cannot be fully installed via the automated pip installer built into Sensoroni.
